# Appliances-Energy-Prediction

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

In the development of a sustainable smart infrastructure, the exact adaptation of energy production to the actual energy demand is of crucial importance. The understanding of the appliances energy use in buildings has been the subject of numerous research studies, since appliances represent a significant portion. The figure below shows that appliances represent about 30% of the electrical energy demand in a household. It is important to predict future energy requirements as accurately as possible. This project addresses the relationships between the energy consumption of appliances, the different predictors, and their influence in prediction. The project discusses data filtering to remove non-predictive parameters and feature ranking. Data-driven predictive models for the energy use of appliances can help understand correlation between various features & quantify their impact. Various machine learning models will be implemented and the performance of each model will be evaluated to find the best one.

**DATA DESCRIPTION**

The dataset used for this project has been chosen from Kaggle and deals with energy consumption of appliances in a low energy household. The dataset consists of 29 features and 19735 examples. The data used for this project includes measurements of temperature and humidity sensors from a wireless network, weather from a nearby airport station and recorded energy use of lighting fixtures.
